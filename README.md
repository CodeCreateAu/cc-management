## Preface

[Code Create]('www.codecreate.com.au') is a venture-capital (VC) backed, ed-tech startup aimed at empowering students to make a better world.

To support the internal operation of the company, the following web application has been developed to streamline onboarding and ongoing processes. This tool is an open-source project which can be contributed to by anyone internal or external to Code Create. If the project is forked and used for external purposes, we would kindly ask that the original source of the code is acknowledged both in the code and any front-end interfaces (such as a mention in the footer along with the company logo).
